### Rake Tests ###
Some stuff should happen when you type 'rake test' in this folder.

### Advanced Test ###
A test which provides it's own EM error handler and uses SSL.


### Better Error Handling ###
Right now if something goes down it just prints the error and forgets about the whole thing.


### Root Certificates are hard-coded ###
This is how browsers do it of course, and I'm using the Firefox certificates. But it would be nice to be able to provide your own root certs for testing/development purposes.
