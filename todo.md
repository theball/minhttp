### Better Error Handling ###
Right now if something goes down it just prints the error and forgets about the whole thing.


### Root Certificates are hard-coded ###
This is how browsers do it of course, and I'm using the Firefox certificates. But it would be nice to be able to provide your own root certs for testing/development purposes.
